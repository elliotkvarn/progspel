There is an everlasting darkness surrounding you
- ... .. .
A sense of panic has started forming as you cant seem to speak
But there are mysterious sounds of a breeze, leafs crackling and a distant howl
You feel a strange current flowing through you
And by analyzing these currents your surroundings start taking shape
A forest as vast as the starlit sky
(I should start to search for some help)
