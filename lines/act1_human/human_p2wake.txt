As you're about to put on your clothes you realize that they look different
You decide to look out the window and it's definitely not your city
(Where am I? It doesn't look like anywhere on earth)
(And why do all the people look so weird?)
(Is there a cosplay event going on? It looks like a fantasy gameâ€¦)
A loud boom echoes through the city
Panic seems to spread outside and you wonder what to do...
Your door smashes open and a man rushes into your room
(Man) - You need to come. It's not safe here!
