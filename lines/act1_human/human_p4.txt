(You) -Soo.. Where are we going?
(???) -To camp? You’ve lost your memory or something?
(You admire the architecture)
(Everything looks so odd. Really does look like some fantasy game)
(Could never imagine that some actual town looked like this)
…
A minute later you arrive at what is apparently your horses.
(Why are we taking horses? Surely there must be cars here right?)
(Or is this some conservative town that doesn’t have any roads?)
(Just where have I gotten myself and who is this man?)
The man quickly gets on his horse, he really seems to be in a hurry.
You follow suit and get on your horse too.
(Luckily I have ridden horses in my childhood)
(This would for sure be embarrassing otherwise…)
You begin to move, and fast.
…
No more than four minutes later you leave the town and quickly enter a oak forest
(I wonder why he was in such a hurry back in the city)
(Did it have anything to do with the explosion I wonder…)
(I probably shouldn't make any hasty decisions but I can’t trust him too much)
You follow a narrow path down a hill
The landscape stretches far into the horizon with trees as far as the eye can see
In the distance mountains peak into the clouds and seem to loom over the valley before you
The sunlight reflects on the leaves and gently touches your face. It is absolutely beautiful.
…
You pass a cart with no horse nor passenger. 
One of the wheels is broken.
(What’s that? Is it really? No. No way.)
There’s a trail of blood going into the deeper forest. 
And then.. A loud screech. From the exact direction of the trail. It is a cry for help.
(Mysterious Man) -Don’t stop. It’s too late.
1: -Why? He seems to need help
2: -Huh?
3: Don’t respond nor question the man. Continue forth
4: -I'm going. I don’t care what happens
