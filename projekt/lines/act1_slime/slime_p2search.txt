You spend days and nights all alone bouncing around the forest
The moon is shining brightly through the crevices along the tree tops 
shining down upon a small pond you notice the outlines of a small figure
You decide to get a better look at the person infront of you
(They seem to be suffering)
You watch them crouching down and shrieking in pain untill they collapse in the shallow water
You slide forward and check on the person infront of you it seems to be a female
(She must have lost her way in this dense forest)
(I have many questions I want to ask but it seems I need to put them on hold)
Wait/Fool around
