You walk down the plaza and hear distant screams
You walk towards the panicking crowd
There is blood on the pavement
It seems like someone has been stabbed
The crowd has started to bundle up around you
You feel distant and your memories are foggy
Your clothes feel heavy
Everything around you starts fading to black
You hear a mechanical voice speaking from afar
It is speaking your name
