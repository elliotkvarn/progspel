After walking through the dense forest you find the man.
(Dialogue copied from other path)

(Man) -It’s alright. Just… go. Don’t let it take you too.
He coughs up blood. He doesn’t have much time left.
You try to speak but you’re too shocked.
(Man) -Please. It’s all I ask of you.

MISSING DIALOGUE

(I need to know his name. I’ll just have to ask)
In a stuttering but silent voice you manage to pry out some words.

(You) -Wha.. What’s your n- name?
The man laughs. More blood spill up from his throat.
(Man) -I’m really going crazy aren’t I? My name?
He lets out another scowl and continues…
(Man) -You don’t know my name? I’m Elric. You’re my brother.
He starts laughing once again but you’re already out of it.
…
Your ears are ringing.
Your vision goes blurry.
Reality is fading. 
It feels like you’ve been hit by a mortar shell.
Even though you've known this man for only an hour, tears are running down your cheeks.
…
PLACEHOLDER (
    The man dies after some more dialogue.
    He tells you to go to a small town, where you'd get help.
)
By a shriek you get pulled back to reality.
The possessed has shown up. And he’s not letting you go away unscathed.
