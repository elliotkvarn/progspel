The yelling for help quickly turns into screaming…
…and the words you could earlier make out earlier are now just sounds.
The man swears.
(Man) -It’s worse than I thought. We need to speed up. NOW.
The screaming turns into something that could only be described as demonic and…
…nothing. It disappeared. Silence.
You’re too afraid to look over your shoulder.
Your only thought is to flee.
Even though you have no idea what this is, you can feel just how dangerous this is.
Another scream fills you with despair. 
You quickly turn your head and there he is. The man. Lying on the ground in a pool of blood.
As you instinctively slowed down you jump off your horse and run towards the man.
(Man) -It’s alright. Just… go. Don’t let it take you too.
He coughs up blood. He doesn’t have much time left.
You try to speak but you’re too shocked.
(Man) -Please. It’s all I ask of you.

MISSING DIALOGUE

(I need to know his name. I’ll just have to ask)
In a stuttering but silent voice you manage to pry out some words.

(You) -Wha.. What’s your n- name?
The man laughs. More blood spill up from his throat.
(Man) -I’m really going crazy aren’t I? My name?
He lets out another scowl and continues…
(Man) -You don’t know my name? I’m Elric. You’re my brother.
He starts laughing once again but you’re already out of it.
…
Your ears are ringing.
Your vision goes blurry.
Reality is fading. 
It feels like you’ve been hit by a mortar shell.
Even though you've known this man for only an hour, tears are running down your cheeks.
…
PLACEHOLDER (
    The man dies after some more dialogue.
    He tells you to go to a small town, where you'd get help.
)
By a shriek you get pulled back to reality.
The possessed has shown up. And he’s not letting you go away unscathed.
